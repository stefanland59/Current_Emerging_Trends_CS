# Current_Emerging_Trends_CS
The goal of this project was to use a neural network to train an intelligent agent to work its way through a maze to find a treasure. The majority of the code was provided to me. I wrote the code that was outlined by the pseudcode in the comments. 

#What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists provide technological solutions for problems in the world. This ranges from a simple computer application to more complex systems like a fully self driving car. It matters because these technologies can improve our lives and move us forward as a society. 

#How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When approaching a problem, I would ask myself is there any software I could create that could be a solution. I would assess what type of software I should create. Should it be a simple program or would it benefit from training a neural network? I would research if anyone else has tried to solve this problem and then see if I could improve upon their work. 

#What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
It is important to design software with ethical responibility in mind. Not doing so, could harm the users and the reputation of myself and the company. If I were collecting data from a user, I would be transparent and let them know what data is being stored. I would try to work with other people to ensure that there aren't any biases in my code that I may have overlooked.
